        Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
        Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
        And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
        Do not go gentle into that good night.
        Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
        Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,

        content: `Survival and shelter—but both against and amidst the dust storms, a blatant contradiction. Though their search may be genuine, the failure lies in seeking to be saved while remaining in the very mess that blinds and chokes them, because they see no other way. They grasp blindly for salvation and meaning in a world where there can be none, for death is no longer creeping over the earth—it is enveloping it.

        But Cooper has a sense of what is truly needed. In a world where people are trying to survive while remaining stubbornly in their current state, Cooper understand the only way survival is actually possible: change. The people need to transform. To transcend their usual barriers.
        
        This change is the effect wrought by the work of the sword. The use of our gifts to convince them of the error of their ways and beckon them out of the dust, and onto a higher plane, for the answers are only found above us, not amidst us.`,

        And her not very ordinary young brother Lou.
        
        At the time of this story Marie is just three,
        While two whole weeks earlier Lou had turned two.
        
        And she was the only one right there to see,
        Just what her young brother was going to do.
        
        Outside of their house was a great big oak tree,
        And how he got up it, no one quite knew.
        
        He had to come down. On this all could agree.
        But just how to do it no one had a clue.
        
        For this tree was as big as a big tree could be.
        Of trees that same size there were only a few.
        
        It was the biggest one east of the Caspian Sea.
        And much bigger than the one that they had in Peru.`,
